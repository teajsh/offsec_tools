### NMAP

**▼ FQDN of the Domain Controller**

nmap-p389-sV 10.10.1.13/24 Go to 10.10.1.22 server and login and go to this pc then right click and go down click on rename this pc advanced.

**▼ Domain Controller.**

**Solution:**

1. nmap -p 389,445 -sV -iL &lt;Target File> OR nmap -p 389,445 -sV &lt;IP> {FQDN = Host + Domain}
2. Or
3. type ldapsearch -h [Target IP Address] -x -s base naming contexts and press Enter (here, the target IP address is 10.10.X.XX), to gather details related to the naming contexts
4. x: specifies simple authentication, h: specifies the host, and -s: specifies the scope.
5. After getting the domain name e.g. [CEH.com](http://ceh.com/)
6. Type ldapsearch -x -h &lt;IP> -b "DC=CEH,DC=com" and press enter
7. In the terminal menu search for versión
8. This will give the operating system versión.

### Cryptography

**▼ DVWA**

1. Open the url given and login with given details. Task-8
2. After login http://172.20.0.16/DWVA/hackable/uploads/
3. They you see files open it and copy the hash value go to the [hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash](https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash). Or try below.
4. hash-identifier paste the text and see the type of hash and then hashcat -h grep MD5
5. hashcat-m 0 hash.txt /Desktop/word list/urser.txt

**VeraCrypt**

1. Use veracrypt to decrypt the volume.
2. Check password is in one system and file is in one system.
3. Decrypt the has using the [hash.com](http://hash.com/) and now you get password.
4. Open veracrypt and upload the file and give password and open the file see the text

**VeraCrypt..**

1. Use [hashes.com](http://hashes.com/) to decrypt the hash for Hash2crack.txt file or "hashcat -a 0-m &lt;hash type> &lt;hash file> &lt;wordlist>" or John the reaper to crack the hash e.g. john --format=Raw-MD5 wordlist=rockyou.txt Hash2crack.txt. You'll get the password. Decrypt the volume using Veracrypt. Upload the file in Veracrypt, type in the password and open the file EC_data.txt.

**DVWA.**

1. Open the URL. Login with the credentials admin/password. Reduce the security level to lowest. It'll be lower side of the page. After login navigate to the required address. We Will get the list of file. Then type ping | type "C:\wamp64\www\DVWA\ECweb\Certified\file names.txt" Like this check all the available files. Look for presence of random stuff in the file. That Will be the required file. Copy and save the content in a file in notepad. We can use base64 -d &lt;File> to decode the file in terminal or cat filename.txt | base64 --decode > decoded.txt or online sites to decode it.

---

### RDP

**RDP**

1. In the mate terminal type Sudo nmap -p 3389 &lt;IP/24> è This Will give the IP of the machine with RDP port open. hydra-l &lt;username> P &lt;/path to password wordlist.txt> &lt;IP> RDP. We Will get the password for the given username. We can use "Remmina" or "rdesktop" or "xfreerdp"in the mate terminal to connect with the machine throught RDP. Rdesktop &lt;IP>, then press enter or rdesktop - u username -p password host:port. Use the credentials to enter the machine. Better use Remmina. Sudo apt install reminna. Then type remmina to open Remmina. Log in using credentials. Locate the image file "file.cfe (Open the file and give the same password from Hydra, put that file in hash calc in the compromised windows machine 2bb407ea) There will be a locked icon on the file. Just double click it. Use SSH top u file to the system. Use ftp to get the file into local system. ftp &lt;IP>. use credentials obtained from hydra. get

Tile content by cat /fllepath/fllename.txt. This will give value.
